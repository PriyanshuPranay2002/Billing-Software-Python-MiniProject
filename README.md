Project Abstract
 
This mini project aims to generate a bill based on the 
items bought by the customer. Customer details, 
item details and other financial details are printed 
on the bill. This project is developed in PYTHON 
using concepts such as file-handling, stringï¿¾handling. Front-end is developed with tkinter which 
is an in-built GUI in Python. Back-end is supported by 
python itself. 

Project Introduction 
 
User gets to select from a variety of electronic 
products of different brands, with desired quantity. 
Each range of product has a different tax based on 
its category. After adding items to the cart total is 
calculated by summing the gross amount with tax 
amount. The generated bill has a unique number 
which is used to distinguish the bill. The bill is saved 
in the system and can be printed if desired. Any bill 
which was generated earlier can be searched with 
the unique bill number. If the user is no longer 
interested in shopping or wants to reset the billing 
information, same can be done with clear button. 
Exit button closes the window. 
 
 
 

Project Background 
 
Front-end of the project is implemented using 
tkinter. Different frames are created to store 
customer information, product information, billing 
area. Items are added with the help of combo-box. 
Customer information is fed into the text field and 
later stored. As the items are added to the cart, 
gross amount increases as per the item rate. When 
all the items are added Generate Bill button sums up 
the gross amount with tax amount and displays in 
the billing area along with customer information. Bill 
can be saved for future reference or searching by 
using save button. Clear button clears the entire 
billing area. 
Print button shows the bill in printing format. 
Project Methodology 
 
Project is created using GUI of python. All the images 
are added using respective python commands. Items 
are added in a drop-down manner using combo-box. 
A specific price and tax amount is associated with 
each product. So, when a product is added to cart its 
amount is also added. Quantity of item can be 
selected by the user. Generate bill button generates 
the final bill with all the customer details, bill 
number, items, quantity and total amount. Bill can 
be saved and searched later.
